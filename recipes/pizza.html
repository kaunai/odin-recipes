            <p>I opted to buy store bought pizza dough for this recipe. But you can choose to make your <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own.</a> As for toppings, I chose pepperoni but feel free to go crazy!</p>
        
        <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
                <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
                <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
                <li>Store bought pizza dough</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="head">Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prehheat the oven to 500 degrees F</li>
                <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough
                    into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.
                    Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. 
                    Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
                <li>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. 
                    Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve</li>
            </ol>
